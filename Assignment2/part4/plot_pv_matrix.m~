function plot_pv_matrix(pv_matrix)
% plot_pv_matrix - Start from any two consecutive image matches. Add a new column to
% point-view matrix for each newly introduced point.
% If a point which is already introduced in the point-view matrix and an-
% other image contains that point, mark this matching on your point-view
% matrix using the previously defined point column. Do not introduce a new
%
% Syntax:  pv_matrix = chaining(first_index, last_index, threshold)
%
% Inputs:
%   pv_matrix -  2M * N  matrix, where M is the number of views and N is the 
%                     number of 3D points. The format is:
% 
%                     x1(1)  x2(1)   x3(1) ... xN(1)
%                     y1(1)  y2(1)  y3(1) ... yN(1)
%                     ...
%                     x1(M)  x2(M)   x3(M) ... xN(M)
%                     y1(M)  y2(M)  y3(M) ... yN(M)
%                     where xi(j) and yi(j) are the x- and y- projections of the ith 3D point
%
